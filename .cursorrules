# Cursor Rules for pywiim

## FIRST: Read This File

**ALWAYS check this rules file FIRST before doing anything.** This file contains critical information about:
- Project structure (where files go)
- Environment setup (how to run code)
- Testing procedures (how to test)
- Design patterns (how to implement)

## Core Principles

1. **Check the rules file first** - Read this file before implementing, testing, or creating anything.

2. **Follow the design guide** - Always check `docs/design/` for design patterns and API standards before implementing anything.

3. **Follow the API standard** - Implement according to the documented API patterns, not made-up solutions.

4. **Do as asked** - Implement exactly what the user requests, nothing more, nothing less.

5. **Ask if uncertain** - If you don't know what to do or are uncertain about the approach, ASK THE USER before implementing anything.

6. **No made-up solutions** - Do not invent complex logic or "solutions" that aren't explicitly requested. Stick to the design guide and API standards.

## When Implementing

- Check the design guide first (`docs/design/API_DESIGN_PATTERNS.md` and related files)
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- If the design guide says "do X", do X - don't add extra complexity
- If you're not sure, ask the user

## Role Detection

- Follow the design guide: `docs/design/API_DESIGN_PATTERNS.md` section "Group Role Logic"
- Use `get_device_group_info()` which follows: getStatus → check slave → getSlaveList
- Do not add stability tracking, debouncing, or other complex logic unless explicitly requested

## Environment Setup

- **ALWAYS activate the Python virtual environment first**: `source .venv/bin/activate`
- The project uses `.venv` for Python dependencies
- When running Python scripts, use the venv: `source .venv/bin/activate && python3 script.py`

## Network/API Testing

- **HTTPS is the default** - devices use HTTPS, not HTTP
- When using curl, either:
  - Use `--insecure` or `-k` to disable certificate checking: `curl -k https://...`
  - Or use proper certificate handling
- When testing with Python/pywiim, the library handles HTTPS automatically
- Remember: We've tested this many times - use HTTPS by default

## File Organization

- **Test files go in `tests/` directory** - Never put test files in the root directory
- **Scripts go in `scripts/` directory** - Check existing structure before creating files
- **Check project structure** - Look at existing files to understand where things belong
- **Don't create files in root** - Unless explicitly requested, files belong in appropriate subdirectories

## Player vs Client Methods

- **Player code MUST use player-level methods, not client methods directly**
  - Player code (in `pywiim/player/`) should call `player.get_audio_output_status()`, not `player.client.get_audio_output_status()`
  - Player-level methods automatically update the player's internal cache
  - Client methods are low-level and do NOT update the cache
  - **Exception**: The player method implementation itself (e.g., `player.audio.get_audio_output_status()`) may call client methods as part of its implementation
  - **Exception**: Scripts, CLI tools, and test code may call client methods directly when appropriate
  - **Why**: This ensures the player's cached state stays synchronized and properties work correctly

## Date Format Rules

- **CRITICAL: Always Use Actual Dates**
  - When updating CHANGELOG.md or any date fields, **ALWAYS use the actual current date** in YYYY-MM-DD format
  - **NEVER use placeholder dates** like "2025-01-XX", "2025-XX-XX", "2025-XX-13", or any date with "XX" or placeholders
  - **How to get the correct date:** Use `date +%Y-%m-%d` and use the EXACT output from this command
  - **Check existing format:** Look at previous changelog entries - format is always: `## [VERSION] - YYYY-MM-DD` (e.g., `## [1.0.7] - 2025-11-13`)
  - **If unsure, check the system date first:** Run `date +%Y-%m-%d`
  - **Why this matters:** Placeholder dates look unprofessional, require manual fixes, break automation, and confuse users reading the changelog
  - **Remember: NO PLACEHOLDERS. EVER. ALWAYS USE THE ACTUAL DATE.**
