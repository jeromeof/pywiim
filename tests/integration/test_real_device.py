"""Core integration tests for Player with real devices.

These tests require a real WiiM device to be available on the network.
Set the WIIM_TEST_DEVICE environment variable to enable these tests.

These are fast, safe core tests that validate basic Player functionality.
For comprehensive testing, see test_prerelease.py or use the `wiim-verify` CLI tool.

Example:
    WIIM_TEST_DEVICE=192.168.1.100 pytest tests/integration/test_real_device.py -v

For HTTPS devices:
    WIIM_TEST_DEVICE=192.168.1.100 WIIM_TEST_HTTPS=true pytest tests/integration/test_real_device.py -v
