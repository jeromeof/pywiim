# Diagnostic Tool

The `pywiim` library includes a comprehensive diagnostic tool that can help troubleshoot device issues and gather information for support.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install the library
pip install pywiim

# Run diagnostics on your device
python -m pywiim.diagnostics 192.168.1.100

# Or use the command-line script (after installation)
wiim-diagnostics 192.168.1.100
```

## Usage

### Basic Diagnostic

```bash
python -m pywiim.diagnostics <device_ip>
```

This will:
- Connect to your device
- Gather device information (model, firmware, MAC address)
- Detect device capabilities
- Test all API endpoints
- Test supported features
- Display a summary report

### Save Report to File

```bash
python -m pywiim.diagnostics 192.168.1.100 --output report.json
```

This saves a complete JSON report that can be shared with developers for troubleshooting.

### HTTPS Devices

For devices that require HTTPS:

```bash
python -m pywiim.diagnostics 192.168.1.100 --port 443
```

### Verbose Output

For detailed logging:

```bash
python -m pywiim.diagnostics 192.168.1.100 --verbose
```

## Sharing Reports

When reporting issues, you can share the diagnostic report:

1. **Run diagnostics and save to file:**
   ```bash
   python -m pywiim.diagnostics 192.168.1.100 --output my-device-report.json
   ```

2. **Share the JSON file** with developers or attach to GitHub issues.

The JSON report contains all the information needed to understand your device configuration and troubleshoot issues.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Errors

If you get connection errors:
- Verify the device IP address is correct
- Check that the device is on the same network
- Try using `--port 443` for HTTPS devices
- Check firewall settings

### Timeout Errors

If requests timeout:
- The device may be slow to respond (legacy devices)
- Network connectivity issues
- Device may be busy

### Missing Features

If features show as "not supported":
- This is normal - not all devices support all features
- Check the device model and firmware version
- Some features require specific firmware versions

## Integration with Support

This diagnostic tool is designed to make it easy to gather information for support:

1. **User runs diagnostics:**
   ```bash
   python -m pywiim.diagnostics <device_ip> --output report.json
   ```

2. **User shares report.json** with support/developers

3. **Support can analyze:**
   - Device capabilities
   - Firmware version
   - Which endpoints work/fail
   - Error messages
   - Feature support

This eliminates the need for back-and-forth questions about device configuration.
