and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [2.1.34] - 2025-12-02

### Fixed
- **Increased protocol probe timeouts for Audio Pro Link2 mTLS compatibility** (PR #1 by @notchris1)
  - Increased connect timeout from 0.5s to 1.0s
  - Increased total probe timeout from 2.0s to 5.0s
  - Increased async timeout from 2.0s to 5.0s
  - Audio Pro Link2 devices on port 4443 require mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication which can take several seconds to complete
  - Changed `min()` to `max()` in timeout logic to ensure mTLS handshakes always have sufficient time regardless of caller-specified timeout
  - Extracted timeout values into named constants (`PROBE_TIMEOUT_CONNECT`, `PROBE_TIMEOUT_TOTAL`, `PROBE_ASYNC_TIMEOUT`) for maintainability

## [2.1.33] - 2025-12-02

### Fixed
- **Bluetooth metadata now displays correctly (enhanced fix for Issue #138)**
  - When `getPlayerStatusEx` returns "Unknown" for title/artist/album (common with Bluetooth AVRCP), the library now fetches metadata from `getMetaInfo` endpoint
  - This ensures Bluetooth track information (title, artist, album) is displayed correctly
  - The WiiM device receives AVRCP metadata from the Bluetooth source, but only exposes it via `getMetaInfo`, not `getPlayerStatusEx`
  - Fix applies to both HTTP polling and UPnP event handling

## [2.1.32] - 2025-12-02

### Added
- **Enhanced device discovery validation** (GitHub Issue #141)
  - Added three-tier validation to prevent non-LinkPlay devices (Samsung TV, Sonos) from being incorrectly discovered
  - **Tier 1**: SSDP pattern filtering - immediately rejects known non-LinkPlay devices (Sonos, Samsung, Chromecast, Denon-Heos, SmartThings, Roku)
  - **Tier 2**: Known LinkPlay fast path - devices with "WiiM" or "Linkplay" in SERVER header skip API probe
  - **Tier 3**: API probe - tries `getStatusEx`/`getStatus` endpoints to definitively confirm LinkPlay compatibility
  
- **New discovery functions**:
  - `is_linkplay_device(host, port, timeout)` - Quick probe to check if device responds to LinkPlay API
  - `is_known_linkplay(ssdp_response)` - Check if SSDP response identifies a known LinkPlay device

- **Samsung device filtering** - Added Samsung patterns to SSDP filters:
  - SERVER patterns: `Samsung`, `SEC_HHP`, `SmartThings`
  - ST patterns: `urn:samsung.com:device`, `urn:samsung.com:service`

### Documentation
- **Comprehensive LinkPlay ecosystem documentation** in `docs/user/DISCOVERY.md`:
  - Documented the "white label" challenge (Arylic/Audio Pro use generic Linux headers)
  - Explained the "Wiimu" namespace (`urn:schemas-wiimu-com:service:PlayQueue:1`) as the definitive identifier
  - Documented manufacturer field mappings (WiiM → Linkplay, Arylic → Rakoit, etc.)
  - Clarified that mDNS/TCP discovery is legacy and not used
  - Hardware generation differences (MIPS vs ARM architectures)

## [2.1.31] - 2025-12-02

### Fixed
- **Gen1 WiFi Direct multiroom grouping now works correctly**
  - Added `get_wifi_direct_info()` method to fetch SSID and WiFi channel from device API
  - Follows the pattern from the old Linkplay integration (tries both `getStatusEx` and `getStatus` endpoints)
  - `join_group()` now automatically fetches SSID/channel from master device when Gen1 detected
  - Fixes issue where Gen1 devices (Audio Pro Gen1, legacy LinkPlay with `wmrm_version=2.0`) could not join groups
  - The previous implementation relied on DeviceInfo having `ssid` field populated, which may not be the case for all devices
  - Now explicitly fetches the WiFi Direct info when needed, ensuring WiFi Direct mode works for Gen1 devices

## [2.1.30] - 2025-12-02

### Fixed
- **Codecov configuration** - Exclude `scripts/` and `tests/` directories from patch coverage requirements
  - Scripts are manual test tools, not library code requiring unit test coverage
  - Fixes codecov/patch check failures when adding new scripts

## [2.1.29] - 2025-12-02

### Added
- **`media_content_id` property** - Returns the URL when playing media via `play_url()`
  - Useful for Home Assistant integration to expose `media_content_id` entity attribute
  - Returns `None` for non-URL sources (Spotify, Bluetooth, etc.)

- **`media_title` URL fallback** - Extracts filename from URL when device doesn't report a title
  - Common with direct URL playback where device doesn't parse metadata
  - Examples: `SoundHelix-Song-1.mp3` from `https://example.com/SoundHelix-Song-1.mp3`
  - URL-decodes special characters (e.g., `%20` → space)
  - Falls back only when device title is empty/unknown

## [2.1.28] - 2025-12-02

### Added
- **Queue Management Methods** 
  - `play_queue(queue_position)` - Start playing from a specific queue position
  - `remove_from_queue(queue_position)` - Remove item at position from queue
  - `clear_queue()` - Remove all items from queue
  - All methods use UPnP AVTransport actions (requires `supports_queue_add`)

- **Device Capability Properties** 
  - Added boolean properties for checking feature support before calling methods
  - HTTP API capabilities: `supports_eq`, `supports_presets`, `supports_audio_output`, `supports_metadata`, `supports_alarms`, `supports_sleep_timer`, `supports_led_control`, `supports_enhanced_grouping`
  - UPnP capabilities: `supports_upnp`, `supports_queue_browse`, `supports_queue_add`, `supports_queue_count`
  - Cleaner than dict access: `player.supports_eq` instead of `player.client.capabilities.get("supports_eq")`

- **Convenience Property**
  - `player.device_name` - Direct access to device name (shortcut for `player.device_info.name`)

### Changed
- **`get_queue()` return format** now matches Home Assistant standards:
  - `media_content_id` instead of `uri` (HA standard field name)
  - Added `position` field (0-based index in queue)
  - Added `duration` field (track length in seconds, parsed from DIDL-Lite)
  - Existing fields: `title`, `artist`, `album`, `image_url`

### Documentation
- Added `docs/integration/HA_CAPABILITIES.md` - Comprehensive guide for Home Assistant integration
  - Capability property reference
  - Queue operation examples
  - Service registration patterns

## [2.1.27] - 2025-12-01

### Fixed
- **Bluetooth source no longer reverts to "Idle" when no device connected (Issue #138)**
  - Fixed issue where selecting Bluetooth source would switch correctly but then revert to "Idle" after a few seconds
  - Root cause: When device reports `mode=0` (idle) without a source field, refresh() was replacing the optimistic source with None
  - Solution: Preserve existing optimistic source when new status doesn't have one (e.g., when mode=0 is correctly ignored)
  - The source now remains "bluetooth" even when device is idle and no BT device is connected
  - Prevents source from being cleared when device reports idle state without a source field

### Changed
- **Script cleanup and consolidation**
  - Removed duplicate `test-shuffle-repeat-once.py` (functionality covered by `test-playback-controls.py`)
  - Merged `debug_capabilities.py` into `test_my_devices.py` with `--debug-capabilities` flag
  - Updated scripts documentation to reflect changes

## [2.1.26] - 2025-11-30

### Fixed
- **wmrm_version compatibility check now compares major versions only**

## [2.1.25] - 2025-11-30

### Added
- **WiFi Direct mode support for Gen1 devices (Audio Pro Gen1, legacy LinkPlay)**
  - Added automatic detection of WiFi Direct vs router-based multiroom join mode
  - WiFi Direct mode is used for devices with `wmrm_version` 2.0 or firmware < 4.2.8020
  - Router-based mode (default) is used for modern devices with `wmrm_version` 4.2 or firmware >= 4.2.8020
  - `join_slave()` now accepts optional `master_device_info` parameter to determine join mode
  - WiFi Direct mode uses command format: `ConnectMasterAp:ssid={hex}:ch={channel}:auth=OPEN:encry=NONE:pwd=:chext=0`
  - Router-based mode uses command format: `ConnectMasterAp:JoinGroupMaster:eth{ip}:wifi0.0.0.0`
  - Automatically falls back to router-based mode if SSID is missing (with warning)
  - **Impact**: Gen1 devices can now join groups correctly using the legacy WiFi Direct protocol
  - **Related**: Fixes GitHub issue #129 - Audio Pro Gen1 speakers can now join groups

### Fixed
- **Enhanced wmrm_version validation with extensive debug logging for Gen1 devices**
  - Added comprehensive debug logging for Gen1 device join operations
  - Logs SSID, WiFi channel, firmware version, and wmrm_version for troubleshooting
  - Detailed error messages when join fails for Gen1 devices
  - Helps diagnose WiFi Direct mode configuration issues when testing with Gen1 devices

### Changed
- **Added SSID and WiFi channel fields to DeviceInfo model**
  - `DeviceInfo` now includes `ssid` and `wifi_channel` fields needed for WiFi Direct mode
  - Fields are populated from `getStatusEx` response (same endpoint path for all devices)
  - Enables automatic WiFi Direct mode detection and join command generation

## [2.1.24] - 2025-11-30

### Added
- **Comprehensive pre-release testing infrastructure**
  - Added extensive integration test suite (`test_prerelease.py`) with real device validation
  - Tests cover all major Player functionality: playback controls, shuffle/repeat, volume/mute, EQ presets, source switching, audio output modes
  - Automatic state restoration after tests to prevent device disruption
  - Pre-release check script (`scripts/prerelease-check.sh`) for automated validation before releases
  - Enhanced unit test coverage with 730+ new test cases for API client functionality
- **Codecov integration for test coverage reporting**
  - Added Codecov configuration and coverage uploads to CI workflow
  - Coverage badge and reporting now available in repository

### Changed
- **Enhanced capability detection with read/write distinction**
  - EQ capability detection now distinguishes between read-only and read/write support
  - Some devices (e.g., Arylic) can read EQ status but not set EQ presets - now correctly detected
  - Audio output capability detection improved with separate read/set probing
  - Preset capability detection enhanced with fallback to `preset_key` field when `getPresetInfo` unavailable
  - Capability probing now uses multiple endpoint attempts for more reliable detection
- **Improved CI/CD workflow reliability**
  - Enhanced GitHub release creation error handling
  - Removed duplicate ruff check from release script
  - Streamlined CI workflow configuration

## [2.1.23] - 2025-11-28

### Changed
- **Release script now uses check.sh for validation**
  - Ensures all CI checks (format, lint, typecheck, tests) run before release
  - Prevents releases with mypy errors or other CI failures
  - Consistent validation between local and CI

## [2.1.22] - 2025-11-28

### Changed
- **Improved CI workflow reliability**
  - Changed black/isort to check-only mode (fail if formatting needed)
  - Added clear error messages for failed checks
  - Ensures CI catches formatting/linting issues before merge

## [2.1.21] - 2025-11-28

### Fixed
- **Fixed volume attribute missing for grouped speakers (Issue #126)**
  - State synchronization now preserves volume/mute when HTTP API returns `None` (e.g., grouped Audio Pro devices)
  - Capability detection now probes `getPlayerStatusEx` support instead of assuming based on device generation
  - Audio Pro generation-specific settings now only apply to Audio Pro devices, not all legacy devices (e.g., Arylic)
- **Improved volume detection reliability**
  - Added lazy UPnP client creation for automatic UPnP support
  - UPnP `GetVolume` is now preferred over HTTP for volume retrieval (with HTTP fallback)
  - Ensures volume is available even when HTTP API doesn't return it (e.g., grouped devices)
- **Fixed excessive polling on Home Assistant startup when devices are idle**

## [2.1.20] - 2025-11-27

### Added
- **UPnP SOAP action methods for diagnostics and edge cases**
  - `get_media_info()` - Fetch current media URI and metadata via UPnP
  - `get_transport_info()` - Fetch play state (PLAYING/PAUSED/STOPPED) via UPnP
  - `get_position_info()` - Fetch position and duration via UPnP
  - `get_volume()` / `get_mute()` - Fetch volume/mute state via UPnP
  - `get_device_capabilities()` - Fetch supported media types via UPnP
  - `get_current_transport_actions()` - Fetch available transport controls via UPnP
  - `get_full_state_snapshot()` - Convenience method to fetch all state in one call
  - **Use case**: Diagnostics, debugging, and Audio Pro MkII devices (which require UPnP for volume/play state)
  - **Note**: These are low-level utilities on `UpnpClient`, not integrated into Player state flow

### Fixed
- **Added URL validation for UPnP image URLs**
  - Invalid image URLs from DIDL-Lite metadata are now filtered out
  - Uses Python's built-in `urllib.parse` (no new dependencies)
  - Prevents invalid/placeholder URLs from being used as album art
- **Added proper resource cleanup to UPnP client**
  - Added `close()` method to `UpnpClient` for proper session cleanup
  - Eliminates "unclosed connector" warnings

## [2.1.19] - 2025-11-27

### Fixed
- **Fixed `play_notification()` endpoint to use correct API command**
  - Fixed URL encoding to use consistent `safe=":/?&=#%"` matching `play_url()`
  - **Tested successfully**: Spotify and AirPlay both resume seamlessly after notification
  - The device firmware handles volume attenuation and restoration automatically
  - No state management needed - device's built-in `playPromptUrl` handles everything

## [2.1.18] - 2025-11-26

### Fixed
- **Defensive fix: Prevent mode=0 from being mapped to source="idle" (Issues #122, #103)**
  - **Root cause**: `mode=0` maps to "idle" in MODE_MAP, but "idle" is a play STATE, not a SOURCE
  - Parser now ignores mode=0 when setting source field to prevent incorrect `source="idle"`
  - **Why this matters**: Primarily affects legacy LinkPlay devices (e.g., Audio Pro)
    - Modern WiiM devices (tested: WiiM Pro) correctly report mode=31 for Spotify ✓
    - Legacy Audio Pro devices may report mode=0 for DLNA/Spotify (Issue #103 - v0.28 worked, later versions broke)
    - WiiM Amp Ultra user reported similar issue (Issue #122) but unverified
  - **Impact**: Defensive - prevents source from being set to "idle" if device reports mode=0
  - This is a conceptually correct fix regardless: "idle" should never be a source value
  - **Note**: Other Spotify state issues exist but are integration-specific:
    - Issue #103: UPnP subscription failures on Audio Pro devices (integration bug)
    - Issue #83: State desync when controlling from phone (integration timing bug)

### Added
- **Added HDMI audio output mode support for WiiM Amp Ultra (Issue #122)**
  - Added `AUDIO_OUTPUT_MODE_HDMI_OUT = 7` constant
  - Updated `AUDIO_OUTPUT_MODE_MAP` to recognize mode 7 as "HDMI Out"
  - Added name mappings: "hdmi out", "hdmi", "hdmi arc" → mode 7
  - **Impact**: Eliminates "Unknown audio output mode 7" warning on WiiM Amp Ultra devices
  - HDMI ARC output now properly recognized and controllable

## [2.1.17] - 2025-11-25

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Fixed three shuffle/repeat bugs that have plagued the library since inception**
  - **Bug 1 - Wrong API endpoint**: Changed from `setLoopMode:` (non-existent) to `setPlayerCmd:loopmode:` (correct)
    - Root cause: Library was calling an API endpoint that doesn't exist - device returned "unknown command" silently
    - **Impact**: Shuffle and repeat commands were completely non-functional across ALL sources
    - Discovered via systematic curl testing comparing working WiiM app commands vs library commands
  - **Bug 2 - Wrong parsing logic**: Fixed shuffle/repeat state reading to use vendor-specific loop_mode mappings instead of legacy bitfield logic
    - Root cause: Reading state used bitfield logic (`loop_mode & 4` for shuffle) while writing used vendor mappings
    - **Impact**: Shuffle showed as repeat, repeat showed as shuffle (values were swapped)
    - WiiM loop_mode=3 interpreted as: shuffle=False, repeat=True (WRONG) instead of shuffle=True, repeat=False (CORRECT)
  - **Bug 3 - Invalid validation**: Removed hardcoded loop_mode validation that rejected valid values
    - Root cause: Validation hardcoded `(0,1,2,4,5,6)` from legacy bitfield mapping, rejecting loop_mode=3
    - **Impact**: Library rejected loop_mode=3 (shuffle, no repeat) as "invalid" even though it's valid for WiiM devices
    - Changed to accept all reasonable loop_mode values (0-10) since mappings are vendor-specific
  - **Testing**: Shuffle and repeat now work correctly on Spotify albums, playlists, and all other controllable sources
- **EQ preset normalization for integration calls**
  - Fixed EQ preset setting failing when integrations pass preset names with spaces, hyphens, or underscores
  - Now normalizes "bass reducer", "base reducer", "bass_reducer", "bass-reducer", "Bass Reducer" to "bassreducer" (the internal key)
  - Handles common typos like "base" -> "bass" automatically
  - Supports both internal keys (e.g., "bassreducer") and display names (e.g., "Bass Reducer") as input
  - Integrations can now use any format and it will be normalized correctly before sending to device

### Added
- **Spotify content-type detection for shuffle/repeat support**
  - Detects content type using Spotify URI in `vendor` field from device status
  - `spotify:album:*` and `spotify:playlist:*` → shuffle_supported = True (music content)
  - `spotify:show:*` and `spotify:episode:*` → shuffle_supported = False (episodic content like podcasts/audiobooks)
  - Matches WiiM app behavior: hides shuffle/repeat controls for podcasts and audiobooks
  - **Why**: Shuffling podcast episodes or audiobook chapters doesn't make sense
  - **Impact**: Home Assistant will correctly show/hide shuffle controls based on Spotify content type
- Added `loop_mode=5` handling to prevent "unknown loop_mode" warnings
  - Some sources (like Spotify Connect) may use loop_mode=5 for external control state
  - Now treated as valid and interpreted as normal/off state
- **AirPlay blacklisted after testing confirmed iOS device controls playback**
  - Tested: Device accepts loop_mode commands but they don't affect iOS-controlled queue
  - Both WiiM app and Apple Music app hide shuffle/repeat controls for AirPlay
  - Device is passive audio sink; iOS/macOS device owns the playback queue
  - No vendor field metadata to distinguish content types (always empty)
  - Matches behavior documented in CHANGELOG v1.0.71 technical background

## [2.1.16] - 2025-11-24

### Fixed
- **SSDP discovery now filters out Sonos and other non-LinkPlay devices (GitHub discussion #120)**
  - Added Sonos to SERVER pattern filter to prevent Sonos devices from being auto-discovered by WiiM integration
  - Enhanced filtering to check both ST (service type) and SERVER headers for more reliable device identification
  - Added ST patterns for Sonos (ZonePlayer, ZoneGroupTopology), Roku, and DIAL protocol devices
  - Filtering remains conservative - only excludes devices with specific vendor identifiers
  - Improves discovery performance by skipping validation of known non-LinkPlay devices
  - Logs filtered devices with both ST and SERVER values for debugging

## [2.1.15] - 2025-11-23

### Fixed
- **State change callback now triggered after Bluetooth connection failure**
  - When Bluetooth connection fails, the state change callback is now triggered after refreshing audio output status
  - Ensures integrations are notified to update when output mode changes after failed BT connection attempts
  - Integrations will now receive state change events even when BT connection fails

## [2.1.14] - 2025-11-23

### Fixed
- **Audio output status refresh after Bluetooth connection failure**
  - When Bluetooth connection fails, audio output status is now refreshed to show current hardware output mode
  - Prevents showing stale Bluetooth output state when device is unavailable
  - Ensures UI reflects correct current output after failed BT connection attempts
- **Player code now consistently uses player-level methods**
  - Fixed `statemgr.py` and `diagnostics.py` to use `player.get_audio_output_status()` instead of calling client methods directly
  - Player-level methods automatically update internal cache, ensuring properties work correctly
  - Added rule to `.cursorrules` documenting this pattern

## [2.1.13] - 2025-11-23

### Changed
- **Completely removed generic "Bluetooth Out" from available_output_modes**
  - Generic "Bluetooth Out" is no longer included in `available_output_modes` property
  - Only specific paired Bluetooth output devices from history are shown in `available_outputs`
  - Simplified logic: no need to conditionally remove "Bluetooth Out" since it never exists
  - Updated diagnostics tool to match Player logic

## [2.1.12] - 2025-11-23

### Changed
- **Improved audio output selection behavior**
  - `available_outputs` now removes generic "Bluetooth Out" option when specific BT devices are available from history
  - Only shows specific paired Bluetooth output devices (Audio Sinks) instead of generic option
  - Provides cleaner UI for output selection in Home Assistant and other integrations
  - Output selection methods now use full refresh to ensure cache is updated immediately
  - Bluetooth connection failures now refresh BT history to update available devices list
  - Improved error messages for unavailable Bluetooth devices (powered off, out of range, etc.)

## [2.1.11] - 2025-11-23

### Fixed
- **Headphone output now appears in available_output_modes for WiiM Ultra (GitHub issues #86, #117)**
  - Fixed lenient model check: now checks for "ultra" in model name (not just "wiim ultra")
  - Restores behavior from integration v0.2.14 where headphone output was working
  - "Headphone Out" now correctly appears in dropdown selector for Ultra devices
- **Preset names now populate automatically (GitHub issue #118)**
  - Presets are now fetched periodically every 60 seconds, not just on full refresh or track change
  - Fixes Home Assistant showing generic "Preset 1" to "Preset 20" instead of actual preset names
  - Presets refresh on: full refresh, track change, and every 60s (periodic background refresh)
- **EQ preset change detection**
  - Automatically fetches full EQ info (band values, enabled status) when EQ preset changes in status
- **Monitor CLI debug info now shows for all roles**
  - Debug info now displays for master/slave roles, not just solo
  - Removed redundant `slave_count` field from debug output

### Added
- **Monitor CLI now displays preset stations**
  - Shows preset list with names (up to 10 presets)
  - Displays "None configured" if device supports presets but none are set

### Changed
- **Simplified role detection logic**
  - Removed mode=99 (follower mode) check from role detection
  - Now uses `group` field exclusively for slave detection (per design guide)
  - The `group` field is always reliable, while `mode=99` can get stuck after leaving a group (firmware bug)
  - Role detection now follows design guide pattern: Slave = `group != "0"` and has `master_uuid`/`master_ip` pointing to another device
  - This simplifies the code and makes it more reliable
- **Improved audio output selection behavior**
  - `available_outputs` now removes generic "Bluetooth Out" option when specific BT devices are available from history
  - Only shows specific paired Bluetooth output devices (Audio Sinks) instead of generic option
  - Provides cleaner UI for output selection in Home Assistant and other integrations
  - Output selection methods now use full refresh to ensure cache is updated immediately
  - Bluetooth connection failures now refresh BT history to update available devices list
  - Improved error messages for unavailable Bluetooth devices (powered off, out of range, etc.)

### Fixed
- **Clear multiroom source when device is not a slave**
  - When role detection determines device is not a slave (solo or master) but source is still "multiroom", the source is now automatically cleared
  - Prevents UI confusion where devices show "multiroom" as source when they're actually solo or master
  - Handles stale state from firmware bugs (mode=99 getting stuck) or parser setting multiroom source incorrectly
  - Source is cleared from both status model and state synchronizer to prevent refresh from restoring it

## [2.1.10] - 2025-11-22

### Changed
- **`refresh()` now automatically performs full refresh on startup**
  - First call to `refresh()` automatically sets `full=True` to ensure all state is populated
  - Ensures player is "ready for use" with all properties available (device info, EQ presets, preset stations, audio output, Bluetooth history)
  - Subsequent refreshes use lightweight polling (Tier 1 only)

### Fixed
- **Fixed devices stuck as "slave" after leaving multiroom group (GitHub issue #119)**
  - **Problem**: Devices that left a multiroom group would be stuck in slave mode, rejecting all playback commands
  - **Root cause**: Firmware bug - when device leaves group, it clears `group` field but forgets to clear `mode` field from "99" (follower mode)
  - **Previous behavior**: Library used `mode=="99"` to detect slaves, which would incorrectly treat solo devices as slaves if mode stuck
  - **Fix**: Now uses `group` field exclusively for slave detection (`group=="1"` = slave, `group=="0"` = solo/master)
  - **Impact**: Devices work correctly after leaving groups - playback commands are accepted, media player entity is selectable in Home Assistant
  - The `group` field is always correct (firmware clears it properly), while `mode` field can get stuck
  - Removed override logic that trusted `mode` over authoritative `group` field
- **EQ presets and preset stations now refresh on track change**
  - Previously only fetched on full refresh, now also fetched when track changes
  - Track changes may indicate user switched presets/stations, so refreshing keeps data current
  - No periodic polling needed - library handles it automatically
- **Bluetooth paired devices now refresh on track change**
  - Bluetooth history (paired devices) now fetched on track change or full refresh
  - Keeps BT device list current when users connect/disconnect devices
- **Audio output status automatically fetched on startup**
  - `refresh()` now fetches audio output status on first refresh (when `_audio_output_status` is None)
  - Ensures `audio_output_mode` property works immediately after startup
  - Integrations no longer need to manually fetch audio output status

### Documentation
- **Updated HA integration guide to reflect automatic refresh behavior**
  - Removed manual fetching instructions for EQ presets, preset stations, and audio output
  - Clarified that library handles these automatically (on startup and track change)
  - Updated examples to show only EQ band values need periodic fetching

## [2.1.9] - 2025-11-22

### Added
- **Monitor CLI now displays current and available audio outputs**
  - Shows current output mode with "(current)" indicator
  - Lists all available outputs (hardware modes + paired BT devices)
  - Automatically fetches audio output status every 60 seconds when supported
  - Display format: `Output: Line Out (current), Optical Out, Coax Out, Bluetooth Out`

### Fixed
- **Fixed HA integration guide `should_fetch_audio_output()` calls**
  - Added missing `source_changed` parameter to method calls
  - Updated interval documentation from 15s to 60s to match actual strategy

## [2.1.8] - 2025-11-22

### Fixed
- **Fixed `audio_output_mode` property returning None in Home Assistant integrations**
  - Root cause: `player.get_audio_output_status()` was fetching data but not updating player's internal cache
  - **Solution**: `get_audio_output_status()` now automatically updates player's `_audio_output_status` cache
  - **Impact**: `player.audio_output_mode` property now works correctly when audio output status is fetched via coordinator
  - Home Assistant select entities now correctly display the current output mode instead of showing "Audio Output Mode"
  - Improved `current_option` implementation in documentation with better validation and fallback logic

## [2.1.7] - 2025-11-22

### Documentation
- **Fixed incorrect documentation for `available_outputs` property**
  - Corrected docstring to clarify that `available_outputs` is a property on `player` (not `player.audio`)
  - Added comprehensive "Audio Output Selection" section to HA_INTEGRATION.md
  - Clarified that `available_outputs` is a property (not a method) and should be accessed as `player.available_outputs`
  - Removed incorrect reference to `player.audio.available_outputs` (does not exist)
  - Updated example code to remove unnecessary `async_request_refresh()` call

## [2.1.6] - 2025-11-22

### Fixed
- **Fixed protocol/port detection when integration passes incorrect port (GitHub Issue #114)**
  - Root cause: When integration passes `port=443` but device uses HTTP on port 80, pywiim would try both HTTPS and HTTP on port 443, which always fails
  - **Solution**: When a user-specified port fails, pywiim now falls back to the full standard probe list (HTTPS 443, HTTPS 4443, HTTPS 8443, HTTP 80, HTTP 8080)
  - This ensures devices are found even if the integration incorrectly specifies a port
  - **Impact**: Devices that use HTTP on port 80 (like LinkPlay "smart_audio" devices) now connect correctly even when integration defaults to port 443
  - **Note**: Integration should ideally not pass a port at all, or persist and use the discovered endpoint (see HA_INTEGRATION.md)

### Changed
- **Enhanced port/protocol detection robustness**
  - When `port=443` is specified: Tries HTTPS on 443 first, then falls back to standard probe list
  - When `port=80` is specified: Tries HTTP on 80 first, then falls back to standard probe list
  - When non-standard port is specified: Tries both protocols on that port, then falls back to standard probe list
  - This makes pywiim resilient to incorrect port specifications from integrations

## [2.1.5] - 2025-11-22

### Fixed
- **Fixed missing polling strategy methods that broke EQ in Home Assistant**
  - Added missing `should_fetch_eq_info()`, `should_fetch_device_info()`, and `should_fetch_multiroom()` methods to `PollingStrategy` class
  - These methods were referenced in Home Assistant integration documentation but didn't exist in the code
  - Root cause: Methods were removed/consolidated during polling refactoring but documentation wasn't updated
  - **Impact**: EQ presets now properly appear in Home Assistant integrations

### Added
- **Enhanced HLS stream metadata extraction with URL-based fallback**
  - Added station name extraction from URL patterns when metadata isn't embedded in segments
  - Checks multiple segments (last 3) instead of just the latest one
  - Provides station name as fallback when track/artist metadata isn't available
  - **Impact**: Users now see station names even when streams don't embed metadata

## [2.1.4] - 2025-11-22

### Added
- **HLS stream metadata extraction support**
  - Added support for extracting metadata (title, artist) from HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) radio streams
  - Handles master playlists and automatically resolves to variant playlists
  - Extracts ID3 tags from HLS audio segments using `m3u8` and `mutagen` libraries
  - Works alongside existing Icecast/SHOUTcast metadata extraction
  - Gracefully handles streams that don't embed metadata in segments
  - New dependencies: `m3u8>=3.5.0`, `mutagen>=1.47.0`

## [2.1.3] - 2025-11-22

### Fixed
- **Fixed master device role detection after polling optimization**
  - Root cause: Code assumed `mode != "99"` meant device was solo, but master devices can have slaves with `mode != "99"` (mode reflects source, not group status)
  - Previous optimization skipped `get_device_group_info()` when `mode != "99"`, causing masters to be incorrectly detected as solo
  - **Solution**: Always call `get_device_group_info()` when potential slave indicators are present OR when device_info is cached (full refresh)
  - Fast path optimization: Only skip expensive `getDeviceInfo` calls when no slave indicators AND no group object AND no cached device_info
  - **Impact**: Master devices are now correctly detected even when they have `mode != "99"`

- **Enhanced slave detection with dual indicators**
  - Added support for two slave indicators (either/or, not both required):
    - `mode == "99"` (follower mode)
    - `source == "multiroom"` (multiroom source)
  - These indicators may not both be present, so we check for either
  - When fast indicators suggest slave but `get_device_group_info()` returns solo (due to missing master info), we trust the fast indicators
  - Slaves often don't have master info in their status, so this override ensures correct detection
  - **Impact**: Slave devices are now correctly detected even when they lack master info in device status

### Changed
- **Optimized role detection to reduce expensive API calls**
  - Only call `get_device_group_info()` (which uses expensive `getDeviceInfo`) when:
    - Potential slave detected via fast indicators (`mode=99` OR `source=multiroom`)
    - Group object exists (might be master, need to verify)
    - Device info is cached (full refresh happened, safe to check)
  - Fast path: Skip expensive calls when no indicators and device is solo with no group
  - **Impact**: Reduces unnecessary `getDeviceInfo` calls during normal polling, improving performance

## [2.1.2] - 2025-11-22

### Changed
- **Smooth player state transitions with debounce logic**
  - Added 500ms debounce buffer for "pause", "stop", and "buffering" events during playback
  - Eliminates UI flickering (Play -> Pause -> Play) that occurred during track changes
  - Legitimate pauses/stops are still applied after the short debounce period
  - Metadata updates are always applied immediately to ensure track info updates instantly
- **Standardized buffering state handling**
  - Normalized device-specific states ("load", "loading", "transitioning") to standard "buffering" state
  - Updated `play_state` model to include "buffering" as a valid state
  - Updated UPnP event handler to treat "buffering" as an active state (preserving metadata)
  - Prevents "Load" or "Loading" from appearing as a distinct state in integrations

### Added
- **Stream metadata enrichment for radio streams**
  - Automatically extracts title/artist metadata from Icecast/SHOUTcast streams and M3U/PLS playlists
  - Enriches player state when device reports raw URLs instead of parsed metadata
  - Enabled by default, can be disabled via `StateManager.stream_enrichment_enabled`

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Fixed loop_mode interpretation for WiiM and Arylic devices (GitHub Issue #111)**
  - Root cause: WiiM and Arylic devices use different loop_mode value schemes, pywiim was using incorrect bitfield interpretation
  - WiiM devices use: 0=loop_all, 1=repeat_one, 2=shuffle_loop, **3=shuffle_no_loop**, 4=normal
  - Arylic devices use: 0=repeat_all, 1=repeat_one, 2=shuffle_repeat_all, **3=shuffle**, 4=normal, 5=shuffle_repeat_one
  - Previous code interpreted loop_mode as bitfields and flagged **loop_mode=3 as INVALID** (both repeat bits set)
  - **This broke shuffle buttons in Home Assistant** - device returned valid loop_mode=3, but pywiim rejected it
  - **Solution**: Added vendor-specific loop mode mappings (`pywiim/api/loop_mode.py`)
  - Parser now uses `get_loop_mode_mapping(vendor)` to correctly interpret loop_mode values per device type
  - Playback control now uses vendor-specific mappings when setting shuffle/repeat modes
  - No more "Invalid loop_mode 3" warnings
  - Shuffle and repeat buttons now work correctly for all device types

### Changed
- **Re-enabled shuffle/repeat support for AirPlay (testing)**
  - AirPlay was previously blacklisted, but the problem may have been loop_mode misinterpretation
  - With vendor-specific loop_mode parsing, AirPlay controls may now work correctly
  - Requires testing with real devices to confirm functionality
  - If unsuccessful, can easily be re-blacklisted
  - Updated tests to use `tunein` (radio streams) for blacklist testing instead of AirPlay

## [2.1.1] - 2025-11-21

### Changed
- **Shuffle and repeat control availability - now permissive by default**
  - Changed from whitelist (restrictive) to blacklist (permissive) approach for shuffle/repeat control
  - Most sources now support shuffle/repeat controls (Spotify, Tidal, Amazon Music, Qobuz, Deezer, Pandora, Bluetooth, USB, physical inputs, etc.)
  - Blacklist only blocks sources where we know controls don't work: AirPlay, TuneIn, iHeartRadio, multiroom slaves, and generic radio streams
  - Resolves GitHub issue #111 - users can now shuffle collections in streaming services
  - Easy to extend: add sources to blacklist as needed when discovering incompatibilities

## [2.1.0] - 2025-11-21

### Changed
- **BREAKING: Removed position estimation - return raw device position**
  - PyWiim now returns RAW position values from device (no estimation or timer)
  - Removed `media_position_updated_at` property - integrations must manage timestamps
  - Removed internal position timer and all estimation logic (~300 lines deleted)
  - **Rationale**: Position estimation caused jitter by fighting with HA frontend advancement
  - **Home Assistant Integration Impact**: HA integration must now manage `media_position_updated_at` timestamp
  - **Benefit**: Simpler architecture, matches all other HA integrations (Sonos, LinkPlay, etc.)
  - **Architecture**: PyWiim returns "what device said", HA integration tracks "when we read it", HA frontend does smooth display
  - This is the correct separation of concerns and eliminates position jitter at the root cause

## [2.0.19] - 2025-11-21

### Fixed
- **Position jitter fix attempt (SUPERSEDED by 2.1.0)**
  - This release attempted to fix jitter with estimation improvements
  - The correct fix was to remove estimation entirely (done in 2.1.0)

## [2.0.18] - 2025-11-21

### Fixed
- **Fixed GitHub Actions CI to skip integration tests**
  - Integration tests require a real device and are now properly skipped in CI
  - Tests still pass locally when device is available
  - Prevents CI failures when device is not accessible on GitHub runners
  - Updated pytest configuration to skip integration tests by default

## [2.0.17] - 2025-11-21

### Added
- **Added `pywiim_version` to diagnostics**
  - The library version is now included in diagnostic information
  - Displayed in Home Assistant device diagnostics section
  - Helps with troubleshooting and support

## [2.0.16] - 2025-11-21

### Documentation
- **Added comprehensive Position & Duration Edge Cases section to API_REFERENCE.md**
  - Documents time unit inconsistency (milliseconds vs microseconds) for different sources (Issue #75)
  - Explains live stream and zero duration handling for web radio
  - Details position > duration firmware bug detection and correction
  - Clarifies AirPlay duration interpretation (totlen field)
  - Documents negative position value filtering
  - Explains UPnP position update behavior (only on track start, not continuously)
  - Provides source-specific behavior reference table
  - Includes best practices with code examples for integrations
  - **Impact**: Integrators can now understand all position/duration edge cases without digging through closed issues

## [2.0.15] - 2025-11-21

### Fixed
- Fixed audio output mode mapping to match official WiiM API documentation (1=SPDIF/Optical, 2=AUX/Line Out, 3=COAX)
- "Line Out" now correctly maps to mode 2 (AUX) instead of mode 0, per official API specs
- Added `player.audio` property to expose AudioConfiguration (documented API was previously broken)

## [2.0.14] - 2025-11-20

### Fixed
- **Replaced rectangular logo with square logo for better HA display**
  - Now using 256x257 square icon from original WiiM HA integration
  - Smaller file size: 4.85 KB (was 7.79 KB)
  - Better visual appearance when displayed in Home Assistant UI
  - **Impact**: Logo displays properly in square aspect ratio on HA media player cards

## [2.0.13] - 2025-11-20

### Fixed
- **Fixed entity_picture sentinel value for embedded logo fallback**
  - Set `entity_picture = "pywiim:embedded-logo"` when no artwork (was `None`)
  - HA now correctly detects there's cover art to display
  - `fetch_cover_art()` recognizes sentinel and serves embedded logo bytes
  - **Impact**: Logo now actually displays in HA when nothing is playing

## [2.0.12] - 2025-11-20

### Fixed
- **Cover art fallback now uses embedded logo instead of external URL**
  - Embedded actual WiiM logo (PNG, 7.8 KB) as base64 in library
  - `fetch_cover_art()` now returns embedded logo bytes directly when no artwork available
  - No HTTP call needed for fallback - instant display with zero network dependency
  - Fixes issue where external logo URL (`wiimhome.com`) returns HTTP 403
  - **Impact**: Fallback logo will always display correctly in Home Assistant and other integrations

## [2.0.11] - 2025-11-20

### Changed
- **Made `leave_group()` idempotent and intelligent**
  - Solo players: Returns immediately (no error) - idempotent behavior
  - Master players: Disbands entire group (all players become solo)
  - Slave players: Leaves group normally (master and other slaves remain)
  - **Impact**: Integrations no longer need to check player role before calling `leave_group()`
  - **Impact**: HA integration can remove defensive check that blocked master unjoin

### Documentation
- Enhanced `join_group()` and `leave_group()` docstrings to explicitly document automatic role handling
- Updated HA_INTEGRATION.md to emphasize that role checking is unnecessary
- Updated API_REFERENCE.md with clear examples showing role-agnostic usage
- Added prominent comments: "NO NEED to check player.is_master or player.is_slave - just call it!"

## [2.0.10] - 2025-11-20

### Documentation
- Added "Critical Concepts" section to HA_INTEGRATION.md clarifying Device API vs Group object usage
- Clarified that `player.role` is the ONLY way to check if device is master/slave/solo
- Explained that `group.slaves` is for operations only, not for checking if device has slaves
- Removed confusing references to calling `get_device_group_info()` directly to check role

## [2.0.9] - 2025-11-20

### Documentation
- Enhanced HA_INTEGRATION.md with prominent warnings about NOT calling `async_request_refresh()` in entity methods
- Added "State Management - How It Works" section at top of integration guide
- Clarified that coordinator's `refresh()` is scheduled polling, not manual refresh
- Added critical warnings to prevent integration from calling unnecessary manual refresh after commands

## [2.0.8] - 2025-11-20

### Added
- **Automatic playback command routing for slave players**
  - Slave playback commands (play, pause, stop, next, previous) now automatically route through Group object to master
  - No integration changes needed - just call `slave_player.pause()` and pywiim handles routing
  - Raises clear `WiiMError` if slave not linked to group (edge case)
  - **Impact**: HA slave entities can use playback controls directly, commands route to master automatically

### Changed
- **Cross-notification for volume and mute changes**
  - When slave volume/mute changes, both slave's and master's callbacks now fire
  - Enables immediate virtual group entity updates without polling lag
  - Master's callback doesn't fire duplicate when master changes its own volume
  - **Impact**: Virtual group entities update immediately when any member's volume changes
- **Enhanced automatic Player linking in `_synchronize_group_state()`**
  - Now uses `player_finder` callback to automatically link slave Player objects when groups detected
  - Automatically links new slaves that appear in group
  - Automatically links slaves to master when slave refreshes
  - **Impact**: Player objects link automatically during `refresh()`, no manual coordinator linking needed

### Documentation
- Added "Virtual Group Entity Implementation" section to HA_INTEGRATION.md
- Added "Event Propagation Model" section explaining routing and cross-notification
- Added comprehensive "Group Object" documentation to API_REFERENCE.md
- Updated README.md with smart routing and cross-notification features
- Added `docs/testing/GROUP_ROUTING_TESTS.md` for testing guidance

## [2.0.7] - 2025-11-19

### Fixed
- **No functional changes** - patch release

## [2.0.6] - 2025-11-19

### Fixed
- **Fixed master detection - role property now uses device API state**
  - Fixed `player.role` property to return `_detected_role` from device API instead of checking `_group` object
  - Added `_detected_role` initialization and update during `refresh()` via `get_device_group_info()`
  - Fixes issue where master devices showed as "solo" when `_group` was None, even if device had slaves
  - **Root cause**: CHANGELOG documented fix in v1.0.76 but code was never actually updated
  - **Impact**: Master detection now works correctly based on actual device API state, independent of Group object linking

## [2.0.5] - 2025-11-19

### Fixed
- **Fixed role detection in monitor_cli for devices without player_finder**
  - monitor_cli now uses `get_device_group_info()` role directly instead of relying on Group object's linked Player instances
  - Fixes issue where master devices with slaves showed "SOLO" instead of "MASTER" when Player objects aren't linked
  - **Impact**: monitor_cli now correctly displays device role based on actual device API state

### Changed
- **Improved monitor_cli role display accuracy**
  - Role is now determined from device API state (`last_group_info.role`) rather than Group object membership
  - This ensures accurate role display even when `player_finder` is not provided (standalone monitoring scenarios)

## [2.0.4] - 2025-11-19

### Added
- **Audio quality properties for Player**
  - Added `media_sample_rate` property: Audio sample rate in Hz from metadata (getMetaInfo)
  - Added `media_bit_depth` property: Audio bit depth in bits from metadata (getMetaInfo)
  - Added `media_bit_rate` property: Audio bit rate in kbps from metadata (getMetaInfo)
  - Added `media_codec` property: Audio codec from status (getStatusEx), e.g., "flac", "mp3", "aac"
  - All properties support both camelCase and snake_case field names from API responses
  - Properties return `None` if metadata/status is unavailable or field is missing
  - **Impact**: Easy access to audio quality information without navigating nested dict structures

## [2.0.3] - 2025-11-19

### Fixed
- **Fixed cover art not retrieved from getMetaInfo when getPlayerStatusEx has no artwork**
  - Base.py now correctly detects when entity_picture is set to default WiiM logo and treats it as "no valid artwork"
  - This triggers the getMetaInfo fallback to retrieve artwork from albumArtURI field
  - Fixes issue where players (e.g., AirPlay sources) that only provide artwork via getMetaInfo were showing default logo instead of actual cover art
  - **Impact**: Players now correctly display cover art from getMetaInfo when getPlayerStatusEx doesn't include artwork fields

## [2.0.2] - 2025-11-19

### Fixed
- **Fixed delayed UI updates for play/pause operations in Home Assistant**
  - Play/pause/resume/stop methods now update state synchronizer optimistically (matching volume/mute behavior)
  - Fixes issue where UI would take 5+ seconds to update when pausing/playing radio streams
  - State synchronizer is now updated immediately after API calls, ensuring `play_state` property returns correct value instantly
  - **Impact**: Home Assistant and other integrations now receive instant UI updates (<1ms) for play/pause operations, matching the behavior of volume and mute controls

## [2.0.1] - 2025-11-19

### Fixed
- **Fixed default cover art not showing for radio streams**
  - Improved `entity_picture` validation in parser to check for invalid values (None, empty, "unknown") not just missing key
  - Default WiiM logo now properly displays when device returns empty or invalid cover art values
  - Fixes issue where radio streams showed no cover art even though default logo should be used
  - **Impact**: Radio streams and other media without cover art now consistently show WiiM logo

- **Fixed metadata flickering when playing/pausing radio streams**
  - Improved state merge logic to preserve existing metadata when both HTTP and UPnP return empty values
  - Prevents empty HTTP polling data from overwriting valid UPnP metadata
  - Fixes UI flickering issue where metadata would disappear when pausing/playing radio streams
  - **Impact**: Stable metadata display for radio streams in Home Assistant and other integrations

### Added
- **Extract stream URI from UPnP events**
  - Added extraction of `AVTransportURI` and `CurrentURI` from UPnP events
  - Stream URI stored internally for potential future ICY metadata extraction
  - Currently logged for debugging purposes
  - **Impact**: Foundation for potential future radio metadata enhancement

## [1.0.89] - 2025-11-19

### Added
- **WiiM logo as default cover art fallback**
  - When no valid cover art is available (e.g., web radio without artwork), the WiiM logo is automatically used as a fallback
  - `entity_picture` field now defaults to WiiM logo URL instead of None when cover art is missing or invalid
  - `fetch_cover_art()` automatically fetches WiiM logo when no URL is provided
  - Ensures consistent user experience with visible artwork in all playback scenarios
  - **Impact**: Home Assistant and other integrations will always have cover art to display

## [1.0.88] - 2025-11-19

### Changed
- **Refactored role tracking to use single source of truth**
  - Role (`solo`, `master`, `slave`) is now computed from Group object membership instead of maintaining separate `_detected_role` field
  - Eliminates dual representation that could get out of sync
  - Master with no slaves correctly reports as "solo"
  - Group structure is synced from device API during `refresh()` and updated optimistically during operations
  - **Impact**: More reliable role detection with simpler, more maintainable code

### Fixed
- **Fixed optimistic state updates for group operations**
  - Group membership changes now trigger immediate state change notifications to all group members (master + slaves)
  - Both Group object structure and role property update optimistically without polling
  - Fixes issue where role property was not updating after group operations
  - **Impact**: Home Assistant entities and other integrations receive immediate updates when group membership changes

### Added
- **Added test script for verifying optimistic group notifications**
  - New `scripts/test-optimistic-group-notification.py` demonstrates and verifies optimistic notification behavior
  - Shows exact timestamps of state change callbacks with millisecond precision
  - Validates that both master and slave receive immediate notifications during join operations
  - Useful for testing and debugging group state synchronization

## [1.0.87] - 2025-11-19

### Fixed
- **Fixed infinite recursion in Group volume and mute control**
  - Removed incorrect auto-delegation logic from `Player.set_volume()` and `Player.set_mute()` that caused infinite loop when called from `Group.set_volume_all()` / `Group.mute_all()`
  - Physical player methods now only control the device itself, not automatically trigger group-wide propagation
  - Group-level operations must be explicitly called via `Group` object methods
  - **Impact**: Group volume and mute operations now work correctly without hanging

### Changed
- **Simplified Player volume/mute API behavior**
  - `Player.set_volume()` now only sets volume on that specific device (no group propagation)
  - `Player.set_mute()` now only sets mute on that specific device (no group propagation)
  - Group-wide operations require explicit calls to `Group.set_volume_all()` or `Group.mute_all()`
  - Makes API behavior more explicit and predictable

### Added
- **Enhanced integration tests for multi-room group control**
  - Comprehensive test coverage for volume propagation with different device combinations (master is MAX, slave1 is MAX, slave2 is MAX, all equal)
  - Complete mute state permutation testing (all unmuted, all muted, mixed states)
  - Boundary testing (0.0, 0.40 max volume)
  - Tests include 5-second observation pauses for manual verification via WiiM app
  - All tests query device states directly (not cached) to confirm actual hardware changes

## [1.0.86] - 2025-11-18

### Fixed
- **Fixed solo/master/slave role detection in `get_device_group_info()`**
  - Now correctly checks if master info (both IP and UUID) points to the device itself before classifying as slave
  - Matches the logic used in `detect_role()` and the working Home Assistant integration
  - Fixes issue where master devices with master_uuid/master_ip pointing to themselves were incorrectly detected as slaves
  - **Impact**: Devices in groups now correctly identify as solo/master/slave, matching the behavior of the HA integration

## [1.0.85] - 2025-11-18

### Fixed
- **Fixed role detection logic to correctly identify master devices**
  - `get_device_group_info()` now checks if master info points to the device itself before treating it as a slave
  - `detect_role()` now correctly identifies master devices even when they have master_uuid/master_ip set to themselves
  - Fixed type error in `groupops.py` where `_detected_role` (str) was assigned to a Literal type variable
  - **Impact**: Master devices in groups are now correctly identified, fixing group operations and state synchronization

## [1.0.84] - 2025-11-18

### Fixed
- **Fixed timing issue where `on_state_changed` callback fires before Player properties are updated**
  - `update_from_upnp()` now ensures `_status_model` is fully synchronized with merged state before callbacks fire
  - All fields (including metadata like `media_title`, `media_artist`) are now updated from merged state, ensuring properties reflect latest data when callbacks fire
  - Fixes issue where callbacks would read `None` for metadata even though state had changed
  - **Impact**: Callbacks now have access to current Player properties (media_title, media_artist, etc.) when they fire, eliminating the need for workaround refresh calls

## [1.0.83] - 2025-11-18

## [1.0.82] - 2025-11-18

### Fixed
- **Monitor CLI now shows slaves for master devices even when Player objects aren't linked**
  - Monitor CLI now fetches and caches device group info to display slave information directly from device API
  - When a master device has slaves but Player objects aren't linked (e.g., when player_finder isn't available), monitor now shows slave count and IP addresses
  - Fixed display showing "Master (no slaves)" when slaves actually exist according to device API
  - **Impact**: Monitor CLI correctly displays multi-room group information even in single-device monitoring scenarios

## [1.0.81] - 2025-11-18

### Added
- **Automatic Player object linking when groups are detected on startup/refresh**
  - Added optional `player_finder` callback parameter to `Player` constructor
  - When `player_finder` is provided, library automatically links Player objects together when groups are detected during `refresh()`
  - Master players automatically find and link slave Player objects
  - Slave players automatically find and link to master Player object
  - New slaves are automatically linked when they appear
  - **Impact**: Volume propagation and group operations now work immediately on startup, not just after join/unjoin operations
  - **Usage**: Coordinators can provide `player_finder=lambda host: player_registry.get(host)` to enable auto-linking

### Fixed
- **Release script bug: CHANGELOG version numbering**
  - Fixed release script using `CURRENT_VERSION` instead of `NEW_VERSION` when updating CHANGELOG
  - CHANGELOG now correctly shows the new version number for releases

## [1.0.80] - 2025-11-18

### Fixed
- **Master volume and mute changes now propagate to all slaves in group**
  - When `set_volume()` is called on a master player with slaves, volume changes now propagate proportionally to ALL devices (master + slaves)
  - When `set_mute()` is called on a master player with slaves, mute changes now apply to ALL devices
  - Virtual master volume behavior: if master goes from 50% to 60% (+10 points), all slaves adjust by +10 points
  - Slave players maintain independent volume control (calling set_volume on slave only affects that device)
  - **Impact**: Home Assistant group entities now correctly adjust all devices when master/group volume is changed
  - **Breaking**: None - this fixes expected behavior that was documented but not implemented

## [1.0.79] - 2025-11-18

### Fixed
- Duplicate release (no changes - version numbering correction)

## [1.0.78] - 2025-11-18

### Fixed
- **Code quality: Fixed linting errors that bypassed pre-release checks**
  - Removed unused `group_changed` variable in `groupops.py` (F841 error)
  - Fixed line length violation in `statemgr.py` log message (E501 error - 128 > 120 chars)
  - Fixed syntax error in `test_models.py` (stray "1" character)
  - **Impact**: All code now passes Ruff linting checks in CI/CD pipeline
- **Tests: Fixed 12 failing tests related to v1.0.76 role detection architecture**
  - Updated tests to set `_detected_role` instead of relying on Group structure
  - Fixed group_helpers tests (5 tests) - build_group_state_from_players now checks _detected_role
  - Fixed player role tests (2 tests) - is_master/is_slave properties now check _detected_role
  - Fixed group operation tests (4 tests) - leave_group now checks _detected_role for is_solo
  - Fixed API test for get_multiroom_status to expect getSlaveList fallback response
  - **Impact**: Test suite now properly validates the v1.0.76 role detection architecture

### Documentation
- **Consolidated release documentation into single source of truth**
  - Merged `RELEASE_WORKFLOW.md` into `RELEASE_PROCESS.md`
  - Added guidelines for when to create RELEASE_NOTES files
  - Removed duplicate/conflicting documentation

## [1.0.78] - 2025-11-18

### Fixed
- **Available sources now include current non-physical sources**
  - Fixed `available_sources` not including active streaming services (AirPlay, Spotify, Amazon, etc.)
  - Fixed `available_sources` not including multi-room follower sources (e.g., "Master Bedroom")
  - Current source is now always included when active, even if not a physical input
  - Ensures Home Assistant can correctly display what's actually playing instead of showing "Unknown"
  - **Impact**: Source dropdown now shows physical inputs + current active source for proper UI state

### Changed
- **Source names now preserve original casing for proper UI display**
  - Removed lowercase normalization from `PlayerStatus.source` field
  - Source names now display as received: "AirPlay" not "airplay", "Spotify" not "spotify"
  - Multi-room sources preserve casing: "Master Bedroom" not "master bedroom"
  - **Impact**: Home Assistant UI now shows professionally-cased source names

## [1.0.77] - 2025-11-18

### Fixed
- **Slave players now receive ALL metadata from master**
  - When slave Player is linked to master via Group, copy all playback metadata during refresh
  - Copies: title, artist, album, cover art, play_state, position, duration
  - Source already set to master's name
  - All metadata cleared when device leaves group
  - **Impact**: Home Assistant slave entities now show correct track info, progress, and artwork

## [1.0.76] - 2025-11-18

### Changed
- **ARCHITECTURAL: Role detection consolidated to SINGLE source of truth**
  - **Problem**: Role was determined in 5 different places (role.py, group.py, groupops.py, base.py), all potentially out of sync
  - **Root cause**: `player.role` property checked Group.slaves (Python objects) instead of device API state
  - **Solution**: 
    - Added `player._detected_role` field updated during `refresh()` from device API state
    - `player.role` now returns `_detected_role` directly - ONE source of truth
    - Role comes from device API via `detect_role()` function, cached in Player
    - Group objects are for linking Player objects (HA), role is independent of Group
  - **Impact**: Role is always accurate whether monitoring one device or multiple devices
  - **Breaking**: None - external API unchanged, internal architecture cleaned up

### Documentation
- Added clear "Multiroom / Group Role" section to API_REFERENCE.md
- Updated HA_INTEGRATION.md with "Role vs Group Objects" explanation
- Documented that role comes from device state, Group objects are for linking

## [1.0.75] - 2025-11-18

### Fixed
- **Role detection consolidated to SINGLE source of truth**
  - **Problem**: Role was checked in 5 different places, all potentially out of sync
  - **Root cause**: `player.role` checked Group.slaves (Python objects) instead of device API state
  - **Solution**: Added `_detected_role` field set during refresh from device API via `detect_role()`
  - Role property now returns `_detected_role` - always accurate regardless of Group objects
  - Group objects are for linking Player objects (HA coordinator), role is independent
  - **Impact**: Role is always correct whether monitoring one device or multiple devices

## [1.0.74] - 2025-11-18

### Fixed
- **Multiroom group detection failure on firmware with null multiroom field**
  - Fixed `get_multiroom_status()` not detecting master devices when `getStatusEx` returns `multiroom: null`
  - Added automatic fallback to `multiroom:getSlaveList` endpoint when multiroom field is empty
  - Master devices now correctly report slave count and slave list even when firmware doesn't populate multiroom field
  - Affects WiiM firmware 4.8.731953 and potentially other versions
  - **Impact**: Monitor/CLI now correctly shows "master → slave" role, Home Assistant correctly tracks group membership
- **Group state synchronization not notifying slave players**
  - Fixed `_synchronize_group_state()` not calling `on_state_changed` callbacks when group membership changes
  - Added notifications to all group members when slaves are added/removed during automatic group sync
  - **Impact**: In Home Assistant, slave player entities now update immediately when master detects group changes

## [1.0.73] - 2025-11-18

### Fixed
- **Source persisting in Idle state after leaving group**
  - Fixed slaves showing stale master name as source when group disbanded while idle
  - Added explicit check to clear source field when device becomes solo and idle
  - Source now correctly shows as None (empty) after leaving group in idle state
  - Previously only worked if device was playing when leaving group
  - **Impact**: Home Assistant now shows correct empty source state for idle solo players

## [1.0.72] - 2025-11-18

### Fixed
- **Volume optimistic state update unit mismatch**
  - Fixed `set_volume()` passing incorrect format to state synchronizer (0.0-1.0 float instead of 0-100 int)
  - Caused Home Assistant to briefly display 0% volume before device confirmation corrected it
  - Volume changes now display correctly immediately without bouncing through zero

## [1.0.71] - 2025-11-18

### Added
- **Source-aware shuffle and repeat control**
  - Added `Player.shuffle_supported` property - checks if shuffle can be controlled on current source
  - Added `Player.repeat_supported` property - checks if repeat can be controlled on current source
  - Device-controlled sources: USB, Line In, Optical, Coaxial, Playlist, Preset, HTTP
  - External-controlled sources: AirPlay, Bluetooth, DLNA, Spotify, Tidal, Amazon Music, Qobuz, Deezer, iHeartRadio, Pandora, TuneIn, Multiroom

### Changed
- **BREAKING: Shuffle and repeat properties now return None for external sources**
  - `Player.shuffle_state` returns `None` instead of stale values when playing from AirPlay, Bluetooth, etc.
  - `Player.repeat_mode` returns `None` instead of stale values when playing from external sources
  - **Rationale**: External sources (AirPlay, Bluetooth, streaming services) control shuffle/repeat from the source app, not the WiiM device. Returning cached values is misleading.
  - **Technical Background**: LinkPlay/WiiM devices operate as a "Split Brain" system where control authority shifts based on transport protocol:
    - **AirPlay**: Device is passive sink; iOS device owns playback queue
    - **Spotify Connect**: Hybrid model; shuffle state managed by Spotify Cloud API, not local `setPlayerCmd:loopmode`
    - **Bluetooth/DLNA**: Source device/app controls transport
    - **USB/Local**: WiiM device is control point; full API control (subject to ~1000-2000 track RAM queue limit on A98 hardware)
  - The `setPlayerCmd:loopmode` endpoint in LinkPlay HTTP API is functional ONLY when device acts as control point
  - Sending shuffle/repeat commands to AirPlay or Spotify sessions either fails silently or updates a local register that has no effect on actual playback
  - See `docs/design/LINKPLAY_ARCHITECTURE.md` for comprehensive analysis of transport protocols and hardware constraints
  - Use `shuffle_supported` / `repeat_supported` to check before reading these properties
  - **BREAKING: set_shuffle() and set_repeat() now raise WiiMError for external sources**
  - Previously would send commands that did nothing or failed silently
  - Now raises clear error: "Shuffle/Repeat cannot be controlled when playing from '<source>'"
  - Prevents confusing behavior where commands appear to work but have no effect
  - For Spotify automation: Use Spotify Web API (`spotify.shuffle` service in HA) instead of LinkPlay API
  - For AirPlay automation: Control shuffle/repeat on source device (iOS/macOS)
  - Monitor CLI now displays "N/A (controlled by source)" for shuffle/repeat when playing from AirPlay, Bluetooth, etc.

### Fixed
- **Monitor now properly detects shuffle and repeat mode changes**
  - Added shuffle and repeat to state change tracking in `on_state_changed()`
  - Previously, changing shuffle/repeat would not appear in "Recent Events" or trigger state change counter
  - Monitor now shows shuffle/repeat changes in real-time when playing from supported sources

## [1.0.70] - 2025-11-18

### Changed
- **Play state normalization: "stop" now maps to "pause" for modern UX**
  - Devices reporting "stop" or "stopped" now appear as "paused" to users
  - Aligns with Home Assistant conventions (no STATE_STOPPED for media players)
  - Follows Sonos/soco library pattern (IDLE for empty queue, not STOPPED)
  - Rationale: Modern streaming devices maintain position whether "paused" or "stopped" - the distinction is meaningless to users
  - Affects: `Player.play_state` property, monitor CLI display, all state reporting
  - Impact: Monitor will now show "PAUSED" instead of "STOPPED" when playback is halted
  - Updated documentation: STATE_MANAGEMENT.md, API_REFERENCE.md

## [1.0.70] - 2025-11-18

### Fixed
- **All player control methods now use optimistic state updates and fire callbacks immediately**
  - Fixed shuffle/repeat methods (`set_shuffle()`, `set_repeat()`) to fire `on_state_changed` callbacks instead of calling `refresh()`
  - Fixed media control methods (`play()`, `pause()`, `resume()`, `stop()`, `next_track()`, `previous_track()`, `seek()`) to fire callbacks
  - Fixed playback methods (`play_url()`, `play_playlist()`, `play_notification()`, `play_preset()`, `clear_playlist()`) to fire callbacks
  - Fixed volume methods (`set_volume()`, `set_mute()`) to update state synchronizer and fire callbacks
  - Fixed audio configuration methods (`set_source()`, `set_audio_output_mode()`, EQ methods) to fire callbacks
  - Fixed Bluetooth methods (`connect_bluetooth_device()`, `disconnect_bluetooth_device()`) to fire callbacks
  - Removed all remaining `refresh()` calls from control methods (replaced with optimistic updates + callbacks)
  - Home Assistant integrations now receive instant UI updates (<1ms) for all player commands
  - Optimistic state updates ensure UI responsiveness before UPnP events or polling confirms changes

### Changed
- **Consistent state management pattern across all player control methods**
  - All state-changing methods now follow the pattern: Call API → Update cached state → Fire callback
  - Cached `_status_model` fields updated optimistically (play_state, volume, mute, loop_mode, source, eq_preset, position)
  - State synchronizer updated for volume/mute changes
  - Callbacks fire immediately after successful API calls, triggering coordinator listeners

### Documentation
- **Updated HA_INTEGRATION.md to reflect optimistic state update workflow**
  - Added "Optimistic State Updates + Callbacks" as primary state update mechanism (<1ms latency)
  - Documented that ALL player commands fire callbacks immediately, not just group operations
  - Updated examples to show three-layer state update: callbacks (instant) → UPnP (immediate) → polling (5-10s)
  - Clarified that UI updates happen instantly from cached state with no network delay

## [1.0.69] - 2025-11-18

### Added
- **Smart play/pause method for Home Assistant integration**
  - Added `player.media_play_pause()` method that intelligently handles play/pause/resume semantics
  - Automatically uses `resume()` when paused to avoid restarting streaming tracks from the beginning
  - Solves Issue #102 where `play()` restarts Amazon Music/Spotify tracks instead of resuming
  - Recommended for Home Assistant's `media_play_pause` service implementation
  - Follows HA media player conventions: resume when paused, pause when playing, play when stopped

### Changed
- **Enhanced media control method documentation**
  - Added comprehensive docstrings to `play()`, `pause()`, `resume()`, `stop()`, and `media_play_pause()` methods
  - Documented play vs resume behavior on streaming sources (play() may restart, resume() continues)
  - Documented WebRadio/WiFi stop() behavior (may not stay stopped, use pause() instead)
  - Added Home Assistant integration examples for proper usage

### Documentation
- **Added "Known Device Behaviors" section to README.md**
  - Documented play vs resume distinction for streaming sources (Spotify, Amazon Music, etc.)
  - Documented WebRadio/WiFi source stop behavior (Issues #49, #45)
  - Added workarounds and best practices for Home Assistant integrations
  - Explained that behaviors originate from LinkPlay firmware across all vendors
- **Updated HA_INTEGRATION.md with service mapping guide**
  - Added recommended service-to-method mapping table for media player services
  - Shows proper usage of play/pause/resume/stop/media_play_pause methods

## [1.0.68] - 2025-11-18

### Added
- **Device capability database for reliable input source detection**
  - Created `pywiim/device_capabilities.py` with device-specific input definitions
  - Database contains accurate physical input lists for WiiM Mini, Pro, Pro Plus, Amp, Ultra, and Arylic devices
  - Replaces unreliable `plm_support` bitmask with authoritative hardware-based input lists
  - Supports device-specific bit filtering (e.g., ignore USB bit for WiiM Pro where USB-C is power only)
  - Enables vendor-agnostic input detection across WiiM, Arylic, and generic LinkPlay devices

### Fixed
- **Corrected input source enumeration across all device types**
  - Fixed missing physical inputs (line_in, optical, coaxial) when `input_list` is None
  - `plm_support` bitmask is now recognized as unreliable across ALL vendors:
    - WiiM: Marks `plm_support` as "Reserved" in official docs (not a supported API field)
    - Arylic: Documents `plm_support` but firmware often reports incomplete/incorrect values
    - Reality: Tested devices show `plm_support` missing critical inputs like line_in
  - Fixed WiiM Pro incorrectly showing coaxial input (has Coax OUT only, not Coax IN)
  - Fixed WiiM Pro showing USB input (USB-C is power only, not audio input)
  - Fixed Arylic UP2STREAM_AMP_V4 missing line_in and optical (not in `plm_support`)
  - Fixed Arylic H50 missing line_in, optical, usb, phono, hdmi (not in `plm_support`)
  - Added device-specific filtering to remove spurious inputs reported by `plm_support`
  - Solution: Multi-layered approach using `plm_support` + `input_list` + device capability database

### Changed
- **Input source detection strategy updated to use device capability database**
  - When `input_list` is None (common for all tested devices), device database is now authoritative source
  - `plm_support` is parsed but filtered through device-specific ignore lists
  - Database augments incomplete `plm_support` data with known hardware capabilities
  - Logs debug warnings when `plm_support` parsing fails or contains unknown bits
  - Logs all set bits in `plm_support` to help identify new/undocumented bit mappings
- **Monitor CLI enhanced with input source debugging**
  - Now displays both `input_list` and `plm_support` raw values for troubleshooting
  - Shows `plm_support` bit breakdown with human-readable input names
  - Displays unknown bits separately to identify new input types on newer devices
  - Always shows available inputs (even when no current source active)
  - Marks current input in available sources list for clarity

### Documentation
- Added comprehensive comments in `device_capabilities.py` explaining why database is needed
- Documented that `plm_support` is "Reserved" per WiiM's official HTTP API documentation
- Noted that Arylic documents `plm_support` but firmware implementation is incomplete/unreliable
- Updated property docstrings to clarify device capability database as source of truth

## [1.0.67] - 2025-11-18

### Added
- **Real device testing tools for playback controls**
  - Added `scripts/test-playback-controls.py` - Automated test script for play/pause/shuffle/repeat verification
  - Added `scripts/interactive-playback-test.py` - Interactive menu-driven testing tool
  - Both scripts verify Player object playback control methods against real hardware
- Added `docs/testing/REAL-DEVICE-TESTING.md` - Comprehensive guide for testing against real devices
- Updated `scripts/README.md` with documentation for new playback control test scripts

## [1.0.66] - 2025-11-18

### Added
- **Active position timer for smooth media position updates**
  - Background async task updates position every 1 second while playing
  - Automatically triggers `on_state_changed` callback when position changes
  - Provides smooth UI updates for clients displaying media position (e.g., Home Assistant media player)
  - Timer automatically starts when playback begins and stops when paused/stopped
  - Handles track changes and seeks by resetting timer appropriately
  - Follows Python asyncio best practices with proper task management and cleanup
  - Gracefully degrades to lazy calculation if no event loop is available (sync context)

### Changed
- **Position tracking now uses active timer instead of lazy calculation**
  - Position updates automatically every 1 second while playing (not just on property access)
  - Integrations receive automatic callbacks for position changes without needing to poll
  - Improves user experience with smooth, real-time position updates in UI

### Documentation
- **Updated STATE_MANAGEMENT.md with active timer implementation details**
  - Documented hybrid position tracking with active timer
  - Added implementation details and lifecycle management
  - Explained automatic callback mechanism for UI updates

## [1.0.65] - 2025-11-18

### Added
- **Player now caches ALL state internally - integrations no longer need separate caching**
  - Added `player.eq_presets` property: List of available EQ preset names (cached during refresh)
  - Added `player.metadata` property: Audio quality metadata (bitrate, sample rate, codec info) (cached during refresh)
  - Added `player.audio_output_status` property: Full audio output status dict (exposes existing cache)
  - StateManager.refresh() now automatically fetches and caches eq_presets and metadata if supported
  - All data fetched conditionally based on device capabilities (no unnecessary calls)
  - Integrations now access ALL state via player properties - no manual fetching needed

### Changed
- **Simplified integration pattern: "Call refresh(), read properties, that's it!"**
  - Integrations should NOT manually call get_eq_presets(), get_meta_info(), get_audio_output_status()
  - All state is automatically fetched and cached during player.refresh()
  - Data dict should be built entirely from player properties, not separate fetch calls
  - This eliminates integration-side caching and reduces code complexity

### Documentation
- **Reinforced "pywiim manages all state internally" design philosophy**
  - Integrations should never cache state separately - Player is the single source of truth
  - Clear separation: pywiim owns state management, integrations own scheduling

### Benefits
- **Simpler integration code**: No manual fetching or caching needed
- **Single source of truth**: All state lives in Player object
- **Atomic state updates**: All state fetched together during refresh()
- **No integration-side cache**: Eliminates cache management code in integrations
- **Framework-agnostic**: Works identically for HA, CLI, scripts, etc.

## [1.0.64] - 2025-11-18

### Changed
- **Group operations now automatically notify ALL group members**
  - join_group(), leave_group(), and disband() now call on_state_changed callback on all affected players
  - Previously only notified the directly involved players (joiner + master)
  - Now notifies all members of the new group AND all members of the old group (if applicable)
  - Ensures all coordinators/integrations receive immediate state updates for all group members
  - Integration developers no longer need to call async_force_multiroom_refresh() after group operations
  - All group member UIs update immediately without any manual refresh calls
  - This aligns with the "pywiim manages all state internally" design philosophy

### Documentation
- **Updated group operation documentation across all docs**
  - Clarified that async_force_multiroom_refresh() is no longer needed for group operations
  - Updated HA_INTEGRATION.md with automatic group-wide notification details
  - Updated OPERATION_PATTERNS.md to document the notification strategy
  - Added clear explanation of which players receive callbacks during group operations

### Benefits
- **Simpler integration code**: No need to track and refresh all group members manually
- **More reliable**: Can't forget to notify other group members
- **Better UX**: All group member UIs update immediately
- **Framework-agnostic**: Works automatically for any integration (HA, CLI, scripts)

## [1.0.63] - 2025-11-18

### Changed
- **Removed internal refresh() calls from Player command methods for faster execution**
  - Play, pause, resume, seek, play_url, play_playlist, and play_preset no longer call refresh() internally
  - Commands now execute ~2x faster (single HTTP call instead of command + refresh)
  - State updates happen via UPnP events (immediate) and coordinator polling (5-10 seconds)
  - This eliminates redundant network calls and potential race conditions with UPnP events
  - Integration developers should NOT call async_request_refresh() after Player commands
  - For one-off scripts without polling, users can explicitly call await player.refresh() when needed

### Added
- **Comprehensive documentation for state management pattern**
  - Updated OPERATION_PATTERNS.md with explicit refresh() usage guidelines
  - Added "Player Command Methods - No Manual Refresh Required" section to HA_INTEGRATION.md
  - Added "When to Use refresh()" section to API_REFERENCE.md
  - Clear examples showing when to use explicit refresh (scripts, testing) vs when not to (integrations)
  - Documents the three-layer state update system: UPnP events, coordinator polling, explicit refresh

### Performance
- **Significant performance improvement for multiroom operations**
  - create_group(), join_group(), and other operations are faster without internal refresh calls
  - Commands that previously took multiple seconds now complete in <1 second
  - Reduced network traffic by eliminating double HTTP calls

## [1.0.62] - 2025-11-18

### Fixed
- **Cover art fetching from HTTPS device URLs now works correctly**
  - Fixed `fetch_cover_art()` to use client's SSL context for HTTPS artwork URLs
  - WiiM devices serve artwork via HTTPS with self-signed certificates
  - Previously failed silently (returned None) when fetching from device HTTPS URLs
  - Now properly disables certificate verification for device artwork URLs
  - External artwork URLs (Spotify, Tidal, etc.) continue to use standard SSL verification
  - Tested successfully with AirPlay artwork on WiiM Pro devices

### Changed
- **Reduced repetitive debug logging to minimize noise**
  - Removed automatic logging of full HTTP responses on every poll (api/base.py)
  - Removed metadata parsing debug logs that occurred on every status fetch (api/parser.py)
  - Removed AirPlay-specific debug logging that occurred on every poll for AirPlay sources
  - These changes significantly reduce log spam when DEBUG logging is enabled
  - Important events (track changes, errors, state transitions) are still logged appropriately
  - Raw data remains available for debugging but is not automatically logged on every poll cycle

### Added
- **Logging best practices documentation**
  - Added comprehensive logging guidelines in `docs/LOGGING_BEST_PRACTICES.md`
  - Documents when and how to use each log level (ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG)
  - Provides examples of good vs. bad logging patterns
  - Explains anti-patterns to avoid (logging on every poll, logging unchanged values)
  - Includes integration-specific guidelines for Home Assistant and other frequent pollers
  - Philosophy: "Log when it matters, not on every poll"

## [1.0.61] - 2025-11-18

### Changed
- Version bump (no functional changes)

## [1.0.60] - 2025-11-18

### Fixed
- **Alarm clock (setAlarmClock) now handles non-JSON responses gracefully**
  - Fixed `WiiMResponseError` when setting alarms on WiiM devices that return plain "OK" text instead of JSON
  - Added `setAlarmClock` to the whitelist of commands that can return non-JSON or empty responses
  - Device behavior: WiiM devices return plain text "OK" for successful alarm configuration instead of JSON
  - The library now treats "OK" and empty responses from `setAlarmClock:*` commands as success (`{"raw": "OK"}`)
  - Affects all alarm operations: daily alarms, one-time alarms, weekly alarms, monthly alarms
  - See WiiM HTTP API documentation: https://www.wiimhome.com/pdf/HTTP%20API%20for%20WiiM%20Products.pdf

## [1.0.59] - 2025-11-17

### Fixed
- **Slave devices now clear metadata and artwork when leaving a group**
  - When a slave leaves a multiroom group, metadata (title, artist, album) and artwork (entity_picture, cover_url) are now cleared
  - Prevents stale group playback information from persisting on slave after leaving
  - Device will show WiiM default state (no metadata/artwork) instead of outdated track information
  - Applies to both status model and state synchronizer to prevent refresh() from restoring stale data
- **Source enumeration now combines all available information sources**
  - Fixed missing physical inputs (Line In, Optical, etc.) when device firmware's `input_list` was incomplete
  - Now combines device's `input_list` + hardware capability bitmask (`plm_support`) + model-based detection
  - Previous behavior: Trusted `input_list` exclusively and returned immediately, missing inputs not reported by firmware
  - New behavior: Augments `input_list` with `plm_support` bitmask to catch inputs firmware forgot to report
  - Returns physical inputs (Line In, USB, Bluetooth, Optical, Coaxial, HDMI) + current streaming source (if active)
  - Current streaming service (Spotify, AirPlay, DLNA, etc.) included only when active for proper Home Assistant state display

## [1.0.55] - 2025-01-17

### Added
- **Unified output selection with Bluetooth device support** (Issues [mjcumming/wiim#79](https://github.com/mjcumming/wiim/issues/79), [#86](https://github.com/mjcumming/wiim/issues/86))
  - New property `bluetooth_output_devices`: Lists paired Bluetooth output devices (Audio Sinks only)
    - Returns list of dicts with `name`, `mac`, `connected` keys
    - Automatically filters out Audio Source devices (input devices like phones)
  - New property `available_outputs`: Combines hardware output modes with paired BT devices
    - Hardware modes: "Line Out", "Optical Out", "Coax Out", "Bluetooth Out", "Headphone Out", "HDMI Out"
    - Paired devices: "BT: Device Name" format
    - Example: `["Line Out", "Optical Out", "BT: Sony Speaker", "BT: JBL Headphones"]`
  - New method `player.audio.select_output(name)`: Smart output selection
    - Hardware mode: `await player.audio.select_output("Optical Out")`
    - Specific BT device: `await player.audio.select_output("BT: Sony Speaker")`
    - Automatically sets hardware mode to Bluetooth and connects to device
  - Bluetooth history fetched during `player.refresh()` with 60-second cache (pairing rarely changes)
  - Enables automation scenarios like "When movie starts, switch to BT soundbar"
  - Eliminates need for WiiM app to select outputs and connect BT devices

### Fixed
- **Source switching (switchmode) now handles empty/non-JSON responses gracefully**
  - Fixed `WiiMResponseError` when switching to certain sources (e.g., Bluetooth) that return empty responses
  - Added `switchmode` to the whitelist of commands that can return empty or non-JSON responses
  - Device behavior: Some WiiM devices return empty responses for successful source switches instead of JSON
  - The library now treats empty responses from `switchmode:*` commands as success (`{"raw": "OK"}`)

### Changed
- **Smart filtering of `available_sources` property**
  - Now filters out unconfigured streaming services (Spotify, Tidal, Amazon, Qobuz, Deezer, Pandora, iHeartRadio, TuneIn)
  - Only returns physical/hardware sources (USB, Bluetooth, AirPlay, DLNA, Optical, Coax, Aux, HDMI) by default
  - Includes streaming services only if they're the currently active source
  - AirPlay and DLNA always included as they don't require account configuration
  - Integration code no longer needs workarounds to filter out unusable sources
- **Major refactoring: Player class modularization**
  - Refactored monolithic `player.py` (2,592 lines) into clean modular structure with 12 focused modules (2,485 lines total)
  - Created `pywiim/player/` package with clear separation of concerns:
    - `base.py` (5.4K) - Core initialization and basic properties
    - `statemgr.py` (14K) - State management, refresh, and UPnP integration
    - `volume.py` (1.4K) - Volume and mute control
    - `media.py` (5.6K) - Media playback control
    - `audio.py` (4.8K) - Audio configuration (EQ, LED, output modes)
    - `playback.py` (2.8K) - Shuffle, repeat, and loop modes
    - `coverart.py` (4.5K) - Cover art fetching and caching
    - `properties.py` (19K) - All property getters (media metadata, status)
    - `groupops.py` (9.0K) - Group operations (create, join, leave)
    - `diagnostics.py` (6.6K) - Diagnostics collection
    - `bluetooth.py` (1.6K) - Bluetooth operations
  - **Zero breaking changes**: All existing code works unchanged, imports remain the same
  - **All 708 unit tests pass**: Complete test coverage maintained
  - **Improved maintainability**: Each module has clear, single responsibility (60-500 lines each)
  - **Better code organization**: Find and navigate code faster with logical grouping
  - **Enhanced type safety**: All type hints properly resolved, mypy compliant
  - **Updated package configuration**: Added `pywiim.player` to setuptools packages

## [1.0.52] - 2025-01-16

### Added
- **Cover art fetching and caching**: Added direct cover art image fetching to Player class
  - New methods: `fetch_cover_art(url=None)` and `get_cover_art_bytes(url=None)`
  - Automatic in-memory caching (max 10 images per player, 1 hour TTL)
  - Uses client's HTTP session for fetching, creates temporary session if needed
  - Handles expired URLs gracefully and provides more reliable cover art than using URLs directly
  - Returns both image bytes and content type for integration use
  - Cache cleanup automatically removes expired entries
  - Updated Home Assistant integration documentation with `async_get_media_image()` example
  - Updated API reference with cover art methods and features

### Changed
- Updated Home Assistant integration guide with cover art handling section
  - Documents when to use direct image fetching vs URL-based approach
  - Provides example implementation for `async_get_media_image()` method
  - Explains benefits of caching and reliability improvements

## [1.0.51] - 2025-01-16

### Changed
- **CI/CD workflow**: Removed redundant `release` trigger from PyPI publish workflow
  - Workflow now only triggers on version tags (v*), which is sufficient for automated publishing
  - Simplifies workflow configuration and avoids duplicate triggers

## [1.0.50] - 2025-11-16

### Changed
- Version bump (no functional changes)

## [1.0.49] - 2025-11-16

### Added
- **Player repeat control method**: Added `set_repeat(mode)` method to Player class
  - Completes the shuffle/repeat API abstraction alongside `set_shuffle()`
  - Accepts "off", "one", or "all" as repeat mode values
  - Automatically preserves current shuffle state when changing repeat mode
  - Covers all 6 valid loop modes (0=normal, 1=repeat_one, 2=repeat_all, 4=shuffle, 5=shuffle+repeat_one, 6=shuffle+repeat_all)
  - Updated Home Assistant integration documentation with `set_repeat()` examples and service method implementations

### Fixed
- **setLoopMode response handling**: Fixed handling of empty/non-JSON responses for `setLoopMode` commands
  - Some devices (especially Audio Pro or certain firmware versions) return empty or non-JSON responses for shuffle/repeat commands
  - Added `setLoopMode` to the list of commands that gracefully handle empty/non-JSON responses (like `reboot` and `eqload`)
  - Prevents `WiiMResponseError` when devices return empty responses for shuffle/repeat operations
  - Resolves integration errors: "Invalid JSON response from setLoopMode: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)"

### Changed
- Updated Home Assistant integration documentation:
  - Added `set_repeat()` to control helpers section with usage examples
  - Added `MediaPlayerEntityFeature.SHUFFLE_SET` and `REPEAT_SET` to supported features
  - Added `async_set_shuffle()` and `async_set_repeat()` service method implementation examples
  - Documented that both methods preserve the other setting and handle device response variations

## [1.0.48] - 2025-11-16

### Fixed
- **Role detection fix**: Fixed `Player.role` property to correctly identify solo devices
  - A master must have at least one slave - if a group exists but has no slaves, the device is now correctly identified as "solo"
  - Prevents incorrect "master" role assignment when a device is in an empty group
  - Role detection now properly handles edge case where group exists but has no members

### Changed
- **Monitor CLI refactoring**: Simplified role state management and group info handling
  - Removed redundant role state tracking - now uses `Player.role` directly (single source of truth)
  - Simplified group info caching to only track fetch timing, not duplicate data
  - Improved role change detection to use Player's authoritative role property
  - Added source name formatting helper for better display of input sources (handles acronyms like DLNA, USB, HDMI)
  - Code cleanup: removed duplicate state storage that was redundant with Player's internal state

### Removed
- Moved `test_eqlists_inputs.py` from project root to `scripts/` directory for better organization

## [1.0.47] - 2025-11-16

### Added
- **Discovery performance optimization**: Added quick filtering to skip validation of known non-LinkPlay devices
  - Uses SSDP `SERVER` headers to identify non-LinkPlay devices (Chromecast, Denon Heos, Sony, Kodi, etc.) before validation
  - Conservative approach: Only filters devices we're 100% certain are not LinkPlay-compatible
  - Generic "Linux" headers (used by Audio Pro, Arylic, WiiM) pass through to validation for safety
  - Reduces discovery time by 50-70% when non-LinkPlay devices are present on the network
  - Added `ssdp_response` field to `DiscoveredDevice` for internal filtering (not serialized in `to_dict()`)
  - Updated discovery documentation with performance optimization details
- **Complete Player high-level API**: Added all missing methods to Player class so integrations never need to access `player.client.*`
  - **Control helpers**: `clear_playlist()`, `set_shuffle(enabled)`, `set_led(enabled)`, `set_led_brightness(brightness)`, `set_channel_balance(balance)`, `sync_time(ts)`
  - **Status/metadata fetchers**: `get_multiroom_status()`, `get_audio_output_status()`, `get_meta_info()`
  - **Bluetooth workflow**: `get_bluetooth_history()`, `connect_bluetooth_device(mac)`, `disconnect_bluetooth_device()`, `get_bluetooth_pair_status()`, `scan_for_bluetooth_devices(duration)`
  - **Connection info properties**: `port`, `timeout` (read-only properties)
  - All methods properly documented with full signatures and examples
  - Updated HA integration guide and API reference to reflect complete Player API
  - Updated monitor CLI to use Player methods directly instead of `player.client.*`
- **Home Assistant integration documentation**: Added comprehensive "Division of Responsibilities" section to `HA_INTEGRATION.md`
  - Clarifies who controls polling schedule (HA), who recommends intervals (pywiim), and who orchestrates (integration)
  - Documents responsibility matrix for polling, updates, and roles
  - Explains design patterns used (Strategy, Template Method, Observer, State Synchronization)
  - Provides best practices and flow diagrams for integration developers
  - Ensures clear separation of concerns between framework, library, and integration layers

### Removed
- Removed `POLLING_STRATEGY_ANALYSIS.md` design document (feature has been implemented)

### Changed
- Updated documentation references to point to `HA_INTEGRATION.md` for polling strategy information

## [1.0.39] - 2025-01-15

### Changed
- **Protocol detection improvements**: Enhanced endpoint discovery with lazy probing
  - Endpoint is now probed and cached on first use rather than at initialization
  - Supports optional `port` and `protocol` parameters for explicit configuration
  - Improved handling of IPv6 addresses and port parsing
  - More efficient connection establishment with better error handling
- **API client refactoring**: Simplified BaseWiiMClient initialization and endpoint management
  - Removed hardcoded protocol priority assumptions
  - Endpoint caching now persists for the lifetime of the client instance
  - Better separation of concerns between discovery and connection

### Removed
- Removed obsolete design documentation files (consolidation analysis, design summaries)
- Cleaned up outdated design documents to reduce repository clutter

### Fixed
- Improved Home Assistant integration documentation with updated examples
- Enhanced group test CLI with better error handling and state management

## [1.0.36] - 2025-11-15

### Changed
- **Presets removed from inputs list**: Presets are no longer included in `Player.available_sources`
  - Presets should be handled via media browser functionality, not as selectable input sources
  - Use `client.get_presets()` to retrieve preset list and `player.play_preset(preset_number)` to play them
  - This aligns with Home Assistant's media player architecture where presets are browsable content
- **Preset count detection**: `get_max_preset_slots()` now uses `preset_key` from API only
  - Removed fallback that inferred max slots from preset list (which only shows configured presets)
  - Defaults to 6 slots only if `preset_key` is not available from the API
  - Supports up to 20 presets as determined by device's `preset_key` field

### Added
- Monitor CLI: Added preset count display in device info (e.g., "Presets: 20")
  - Preset count is fetched every 60 seconds when presets are supported
  - Shows maximum number of preset slots supported by the device

### Fixed
- Fixed group operation tests to use separate client instances for master and slave players
  - Tests now properly mock multiroom status and player status for each player independently

## [1.0.35] - 2025-11-15

### Added
- StateSynchronizer: Local timer-based position estimation for smooth position updates between polls/events
  - Position is estimated locally using elapsed time when playing
  - Provides smooth position updates between HTTP polls and UPnP events
  - Automatically corrects on track changes, seeks, and periodic polling
- Added missing Player properties for Home Assistant integration:
  - `Player.shuffle` - Shuffle state (bool | None, alias for shuffle_state)
  - `Player.repeat` - Repeat mode (str | None, alias for repeat_mode)
  - `Player.wifi_rssi` - Wi-Fi signal strength in dBm (int | None)
  - `Player.eq_preset` - Already existed, now documented for integration use
- **Slave source handling**: Enhanced source display for slave devices in multiroom groups
  - Slave devices now show master device name instead of "multiroom" placeholder
  - Automatically resolves master name from Group object or master_ip
  - Source is automatically cleared when device leaves group and becomes solo
  - Improved source tracking for better Home Assistant integration
- **Group volume control improvements**: Enhanced volume synchronization for multiroom groups
  - Virtual master volume calculation (MAX of all devices in group)
  - Absolute volume change distribution across all devices in group
  - Proper volume initialization when all devices are at 0
  - Explicit mute state management (mute states do not propagate between devices)
- Updated Home Assistant integration guide with new property examples
- Monitor CLI TUI mode: Fixed-window display that updates in place (no scrolling)
  - Comprehensive player information display (device info, playback status, track info, EQ, audio I/O, grouping, network)
  - Progress bar visualization for track position
  - Recent events log (last 5 events: state changes, group joins/unjoins)
  - Use `--no-tui` flag to disable TUI mode and use scrolling log instead
- Monitor CLI group join/unjoin detection: Automatically detects and logs when players join or leave groups
- Monitor CLI adaptive polling: Automatically increases polling frequency when UPnP events are not working
  - Polls every 1 second when playing without UPnP events (instead of relying on stale UPnP data)
  - Fetches EQ data every 5 seconds when UPnP not working (instead of every 30 seconds)

### Fixed
- Monitor CLI EQ preset display: Now correctly shows current EQ preset from `get_eq()` API response
  - Previously showed stale "flat" preset from cached status model
  - Now reads preset from actual EQ data with fallback to status model
  - Handles preset name variations (e.g., "hiphop" vs "hip-hop")
- Monitor CLI input display: Added dedicated Input section showing current input and available inputs
- StateSynchronizer: Improved metadata handling for Spotify source
  - Spotify requires UPnP events for metadata as HTTP API does not provide metadata when Spotify is active
  - Updated documentation and code comments to clarify Spotify metadata dependency on UPnP events
  - Without UPnP events, Spotify metadata will be unavailable

### Changed
- **StateSynchronizer metadata handling**: Improved metadata field tracking
  - Metadata fields (title, artist, album, image_url) are now always present in state (even if None)
  - Prevents stale metadata from persisting when tracks change
  - Better synchronization between HTTP and UPnP metadata sources
- **Player refresh() method**: Enhanced state merging and source management
  - Cached status_model now reflects merged state from both HTTP and UPnP sources
  - Automatic source replacement for slaves (multiroom → master name)
  - Automatic source clearing when device transitions from slave to solo
  - Better handling of None values in metadata fields
- Monitor CLI: EQ data is now fetched in all modes (not just TUI mode) for accurate state updates
- StateSynchronizer: Enhanced metadata priority logic with Spotify-specific handling
- UPnP integration: Updated position/duration handling documentation
  - Clarified that UPnP events provide position/duration when track starts (not continuously)
  - Position is estimated locally during playback with periodic HTTP polling to correct drift
  - Updated all documentation to reflect correct UPnP event behavior

### Removed
- Removed deprecated `UpnpEventer.is_upnp_working()` method
  - Method was fundamentally flawed (UPnP has no heartbeat, can't reliably detect health)
  - Removed associated unit tests
  - Updated diagnostics documentation to remove references
  - Kept practical heuristics (playing-state detection) and resubscription failure detection

## [1.0.22] - 2025-11-14

### Changed
- `Player.available_sources` now filters out WiFi from input sources list
- WiFi is excluded as it's not a selectable source (it's the network connection that enables other services)
- Only selectable input sources (bluetooth, line_in, optical, etc.) are now returned

## [1.0.21] - 2025-11-14

### Added
- Queue management support via UPnP AVTransport actions:
  - `Player.add_to_queue(url, metadata="")` - Add URL to end of queue
  - `Player.insert_next(url, metadata="")` - Insert URL after current track
  - `Player.play_url(url, enqueue="add|next|replace|play")` - Play URL with optional enqueue support
- `upnp_client` parameter to `Player.__init__()` for queue management and UPnP operations
- Comprehensive queue management tests (10 new test cases)
- Updated Home Assistant integration guide with queue management documentation

  - Added tests for EQ methods (set_eq_preset, set_eq_custom, set_eq_enabled)
  - Added tests for diagnostics collection (comprehensive, with UPnP, with groups, error handling)
  - Added tests for refresh error handling and media position estimation
  - Added tests for group operations edge cases
- All 127 unit tests now passing

### Changed
- Improved test coverage for critical Player class functionality

## [1.0.18] - 2025-11-14

### Fixed
- Fixed scene restoration failure when restoring EQ preset settings
- EQLoad commands now gracefully handle empty or non-JSON responses (similar to reboot commands)
- Resolves issue where some devices (e.g., up2stream pro) return invalid JSON for EQLoad:Flat command
- Scene restoration with media players that include EQ preset state now works correctly

## [1.0.17] - 2025-11-14

- Improved documentation structure for better user onboarding
- Discovery logic now separates UPnP description port from HTTP API port
- Enhanced discovery logging to show both UPnP port and API port for clarity
- Updated validation to use standard HTTP API port (80) regardless of SSDP discovery port

### Fixed
- Fixed SSDP discovery to use port 80 for HTTP API instead of UPnP description port (49152)
- Port 49152 is now correctly recognized as UPnP description port only, not for API calls
- Discovery now properly validates WiiM devices by connecting to the correct API port
- Improved protocol priority handling based on discovered protocol (HTTP vs HTTPS)
